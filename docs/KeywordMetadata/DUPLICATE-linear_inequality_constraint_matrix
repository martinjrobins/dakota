Define coefficients of the linear inequality constraints
Description::
In the inequality case, the
constraint matrix \f$A\f$ provides coefficients for the variables in the
two-sided formulation:
\f[a_l \leq Ax \leq a_u\f]

Where the bounds are optionally specified by \c linear_inequality_lower_bounds, 
and \c linear_inequality_upper_bounds.
The bounds, if not specified, will default to -infinity, and 0, respectively,
resulting in 
one-sided inequalities of the form
\f[Ax \leq 0.0\f].
