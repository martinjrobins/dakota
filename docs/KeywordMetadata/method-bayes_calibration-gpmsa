Blurb:: (Experimental) Gaussian Process Models for Simulation Analysis (GPMSA)
Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm with Gaussian Process Surrogate
Description::
GPMSA (Gaussian Process Models for Simulation Analysis) is another 
approach that provides the capability for Bayesian
calibration. The GPMSA implementation currently is an experimental capability and not ready for production use at this time. 
A key part of GPMSA is the construction of an emulator from simulation runs
collected at various settings of input parameters. The emulator is a
statistical model of the system response, and it is used to incorporate
the observational data to improve system predictions and constrain or
calibrate the unknown parameters. The GPMSA code draws heavily
on the theory developed in the seminal Bayesian calibration paper
by Kennedy and O'Hagan \cite Kenn01. 
The particular approach in GPMSA has been developed
by the Los Alamos group and document in \cite Hig08. 
GPMSA uses
Gaussian process models in the emulation, but the emulator is
actually a set of basis functions (e.g. from a singular value
decomposition) which have GPs as the coefficients. 

For the GPMSA method, one can define the number of samples which will be used 
in construction of the emulator, \c emulator_samples. The emulator 
involves Gaussian processes in GPMSA, so the user does not specify anything 
about emulator type. At this point, the only controls active for GPMSA 
are \c emulator_samples, \c seed and \c rng, and \c samples (the number of MCMC
samples) and the type of MCMC algorithm (e.g. \c dram, \c delayed_rejection, 
\c adaptive_metropolis, \c metropolis_hastings, or \c multilevel).  
NOTE: the GPMSA method is in a very preliminary, prototype state at this time. 
The user will need to modify certain data structures in the code for their particular application and recompile to run
with GPMSA.
