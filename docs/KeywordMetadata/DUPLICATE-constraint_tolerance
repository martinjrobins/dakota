The maximum allowable value of constraint violation still considered to be feasible
Description::
The \c constraint_tolerance specification determines the maximum
allowable value of infeasibility that any constraint in an
optimization problem may possess and still be considered to be
satisfied.

If a constraint
function is greater than this value then it is considered to be
violated by the optimization algorithm. This specification gives some
control over how tightly the constraints will be satisfied at
convergence of the algorithm. However, if the value is set too small
the algorithm may terminate with one or more constraints being
violated. 

This specification is currently meaningful for the NPSOL,
NLSSOL, DOT and CONMIN constrained optimizers.

<b> Defaults </b>

Defaults can vary depending on the method.
\li DOT constrained optimizers: 0.003
\li NPSOL: dependent upon the machine precision, typically on the order of \c 1.e-8 for double precision computations
