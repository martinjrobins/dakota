Add context to experiment data description:  specify the type of experimental error. 
Description::
There are three options for specifying the experimental error (e.g. the measurement 
error in the data you provide for calibration purposes): 
NO_SIGMA, SCALAR_SIGMA, or COVARIANCE_MATRIX.  If the user specifies NO_SIGMA, 
Dakota will calculate a sigma term (one constant sigma term across all of the data)
based on the data.  If the user specifies SCALAR_SIGMA, they can provide either 
a constant sigma term across all the data or a vector of sigma terms, where one is 
provided for each measurement.  If the user specifies COVARIANCE_MATRIX, which is only 
allowed for field data, the user then needs to specify an M-by-M covariance 
matrix, where each element(i,j) of the covariance matrix represents 
the covariance between the i-th and j-th field values.
