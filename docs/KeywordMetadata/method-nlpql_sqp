Sequential Quadratic Program
Description::
NLPQL provides an implementation of sequential quadratic programming through 
\c nlpqp_sqp.  The particular SQP implementation in \c nlpql_sqp uses a variant with
distributed and non-monotone line search.
Thus, this variant is designed to be more robust in the presence of
inaccurate or noisy gradients common in many engineering applications.

The method independent controls for maximum iterations and output
verbosity are mapped to NLPQL controls MAXIT and IPRINT, respectively.
The maximum number of function evaluations is enforced within the
NLPQLPOptimizer class.
