Blurb:: Perform deterministic optimization for MAP before Bayesian calibration

Description::
When specified, Dakota will perform a deterministic gradient-based
optimization to maximize the log posterior (log-likelihood -
log_prior).  The Markov Chain in Bayesian calibration will be started
at the best point found in the optimization (the MAP point).
Note that both optimization methods available (\c sqp and \c nip) 
require gradients.  The gradients will be assessed based on 
the model the user specifies (e.g. if an emulator is used, the 
gradients will be taken with respect to the emulator, otherwise 
they will be based on the user specification for the model, either 
finite-difference or analytic gradients.)

<b> Default Behavior </b>
No MAP pre-solve; simply start the MCMC process at the user-specified
initial value.

<b> Expected Output </b>
When pre-solve is enabled, the output will include a deterministic
optimization, followed by a Bayesian calibration.  The final results
will include the MAP point as well as posterior statistics from the
MCMC chain.
