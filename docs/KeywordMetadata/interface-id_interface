Name the interface block; helpful when there are multiple

Description::
The optional set identifier specification uses the keyword \c
id_interface to input a string for use in identifying a particular
interface specification. 
A model can then identify the use of this
interface by specifying the same string in its \c interface_pointer
specification. 

If the \c
id_interface specification is omitted, a particular interface
specification will be used by a model only if that model omits
specifying a \c interface_pointer and if the interface set was the
last set parsed (or is the only set parsed). In common practice, if
only one interface set exists, then \c id_interface can be safely
omitted from the interface specification and \c interface_pointer can
be omitted from the model specification(s), since there is no
potential for ambiguity in this case.

Examples::
For example, a model whose
specification contains \c interface_pointer = 'I1' will use an
interface specification with \c id_interface = 'I1'.
