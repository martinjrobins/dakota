Choose a scaling type for each response
Description::
The \c primary_scale_types keyword specifies one of number of primary
functions strings indicating the scaling type for each response value
in methods that support scaling, when scaling is enabled.

See the \c scaling keyword in the \ref method section for details on how to use this
keyword.  Note that primary response functions (objective,
calibration, or response functions) cannot be automaticaly scaled due
to lack of bounds, so valid scale types are \c 'none' \c 'value' and
\c 'log'.
