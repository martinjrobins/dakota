Name the variables block; helpful when there are multiple

Description::
The optional set identifier specification uses the keyword \c
id_variables to input a unique string for use in identifying a
particular variables set. A model can then identify the use of this
variables set by specifying the same string in its \c
variables_pointer specification.

If the \c id_variables specification is omitted, a particular variables
set will be used by a model only if that model omits specifying a \c 
variables_pointer and if the variables set was the last set parsed (or
is the only set parsed). In common practice, if only one variables set
exists, then \c id_variables can be safely omitted from the variables
specification and \c variables_pointer can be omitted from the model
specification(s), since there is no potential for ambiguity in this
case.

Examples::
For
example, a model whose specification contains 
<tt>variables_pointer = 'V1'</tt> will use a variables specification 
containing the set identifier <tt>id_variables = 'V1'</tt>.
