Specify the number of samples taken on the emulator to estimate the Numerical Integration in RKD Darts.

Description::
*** Disclaimer: The RKD method is currently in development mode, for further experimental verification. 
*** Please contact Dakota team if you have further questions about using this method.

The last step of the RKD Darts method involves constructing an emulator over the points identified thus far, and sampling that emulator extensively to estimate the value of the numerical integration. \c emulator_samples allows one to specify the number of samples taken on the emulator. The default is 1E+6.
