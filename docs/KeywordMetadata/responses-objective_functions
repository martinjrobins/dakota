Blurb::
Response type suitable for optimization
Description::
The \c objective_functions keyword specifies the number of objective 
functions returned to Dakota.
The number of objective functions must be 1 or greater.

<b> Constraints </b>

The keywords \c nonlinear_inequality_constraints, and \c nonlinear_equality_constraints 
specify the number of nonlinear inequality
constraints, and nonlinear equality constraints, respectively. 
When interfacing to external applications, the responses must be returned
to %Dakota in this order: objective functions, nonlinear_inequality_constraints,
then nonlinear_equality_constraints.

Any linear constraints present in an application need only be input to
an optimizer at start up and do not need to be part of the data
returned on every function evaluation. These are therefore specified in the \ref method block.

Bounds on the design variables are specified in the \ref variables block.

<b> Optional Keywords </b>

The optional keywords relate to scaling the objective functions (for
better numerical results), formulating the problem as minimization or
maximization, and dealing with multiple objective functions.  If
scaling is used, it is applied before multi-objective weighted sums
are formed.
