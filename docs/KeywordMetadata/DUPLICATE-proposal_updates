Blurb::Restarts the MCMC chain with updated derivative-based proposal covariance.

Description::
When employing derivative-based proposal covariance, this specification
defines the number of restarts that are performed
during the course of the total sample size of the MCMC chain.  For each 
restart, a new chain is initiated from the final point in the previous 
acceptance chain using updated proposal covariance corresponding to the
derivatives values at the new starting point.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If proposal_updates is not specified, then the default frequency for
restarting the chain with updated proposal covariance is every 100 
samples.

<b> Expected Output </b>

Each restarted chain will generate a new QUESO header and sampling summary,
and the chain diagnostics will be appended within the outputData directory.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

proposal_updates should be tailored to the size of the total chain,
accounting for the relative expense of derivative-based proposal updates.
