Radial basis function (RBF) model

Description::
Radial basis functions\f$\phi\f$ are functions whose value typically
depends on the distance from a center point, called the centroid,
\f${\bf c}\f$.

The surrogate model approximation comprises a sum of K weighted radial
basis functions:
\f[ \hat{f}({\bf x})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{k}\phi({\parallel {\bf x} - {\bf c_{k}} \parallel}) \f]

These basis functions take many forms, but Gaussian kernels or splines
are most common.  The Dakota implementation uses a Gaussian radial
basis function.  The weights are determined via a linear least squares
solution approach.  See \cite Orr96 for more details.
