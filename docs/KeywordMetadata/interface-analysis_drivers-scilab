Run Scilab with a direct interface - requires special Dakota build
Description::
%Dakota supports library-linked interfaces to Matlab, Scilab, and
Python scientific computation software, but they must be explicitly
enabled when compiling %Dakota from source. First consult the Users
Manual \cite UsersMan for discussion and
examples. 

Contact the %Dakota users mailing list for assistance
building and using %Dakota with these interfaces. 

In all these
interfaces, the \c analysis_driver is used to specify a Matlab,
Scilab, or Python file which implements the parameter to response
mapping.
