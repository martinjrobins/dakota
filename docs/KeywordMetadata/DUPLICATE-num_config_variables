Blurb::
Add context to data: number of configuration variables.
Description::
This is an optional description.  If there are multiple experiments, 
there can be different configuration variables (e.g. experimental settings, 
boundary conditions, etc.) per experiment.
See \ref responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data or 
\ref responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file.
Note:  as of Dakota 6.2, configuration variables are not used.  However, the intent is to 
treat them as state variables which will be passed to the simulation, and not treated as 
parameters which are calibrated.
