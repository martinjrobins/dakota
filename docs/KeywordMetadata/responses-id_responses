Name the response block, helpful when there are multiple

Description::
The optional block identifier \c id_responses specifies a string to
uniquely identify a particular responses specification (typically used
when there are multiple present).  A \ref model can then specify or
point to this response set by specifying the same string in its \c
responses_pointer specification. For example, a model whose
specification contains <tt>responses_pointer = 'R1'</tt> will use a
responses set with <tt>id_responses = 'R1'</tt>.

If the \c id_responses specification is omitted, a particular
responses specification will be used by a model only if that model
omits specifying a \c responses_pointer and if the responses set was
the last set parsed (or is the only set parsed). In common practice,
if only one responses set exists, then \c id_responses can be safely
omitted from the responses specification and \c responses_pointer can
be omitted from the model specification(s), since there is no
potential for ambiguity in this case.
