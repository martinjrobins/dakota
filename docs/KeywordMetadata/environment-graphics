Blurb::
Display a 2D graphics window of variables and responses
Description::
For most studies, the \c graphics flag activates a 2D graphics window
containing history plots for the variables and response functions in
the study. This window is updated in an event loop with approximately
a 2 second cycle time.  Some study types such as surrogate-based
optimization or local reliability specialize the use of the graphics
window.

There is no dependence between the \c graphics flag and the \c
tabular_data flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.
