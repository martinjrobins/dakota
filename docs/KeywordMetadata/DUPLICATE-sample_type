Selection of sampling strategy

Description::
The \c sample_type keyword allows the user to select between multiple
random sampling approaches.  There are two primary types of sampling:
Monte Carlo (pure random) and Latin Hypercube Sampling.  Additionally,
these methods have incremental variants that allow an existing study
to be augmented with additional samples to get better estimates of
mean, variance, and percentiles.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If the \c sample_type keyword is present, it must be accompanied by \c
lhs, \c random, \c incremental_lhs, or \c incremental_random.
Otherwise, \c lhs will be used by default.
