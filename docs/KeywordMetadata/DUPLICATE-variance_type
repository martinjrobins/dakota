Add context to experiment data description by specifying the type of experimental error. 

Description::
There are four options for specifying the experimental error (e.g. the measurement 
error in the data you provide for calibration purposes): 
'none', 'scalar', 'diagonal', or 'matrix.' 

If the user specifies none, 
Dakota will calculate a variance (sigma-squared) term.  This will be a constant variance term across all of the data).
If the user specifies scalar, they can provide a scalar variance per 
calibration term. 
Note that for scalar calibration terms, only 'none' or 'scalar' are 
options for the measurement variance.  However, for field calibration terms, 
there are two additional options.  'diagonal' allows the user to provide 
a vector of measurement variances (one for each term in the calibration field).  This vector corresponds to the diagonal of the full covariance matrix of measurement errors.  If the user specifies 'matrix', they can provide a full 
covariance matrix (not just the diagonal terms), where each 
element(i,j) of the covariance matrix represents 
the covariance of the measurement error between the i-th and j-th field values.
