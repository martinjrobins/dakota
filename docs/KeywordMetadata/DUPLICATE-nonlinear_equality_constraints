Blurb::
Group to specify nonlinear equality constraints
Description::

The \c targets specification provides the targets for nonlinear
equalities of the form
\f[g(x) = g_t\f]
and the defaults for the equality targets enforce a value of \c 0.
for each constraint
\f[g(x) = 0.0\f]

The \c scale_types and \c scales keywords are related to scaling
of \f$ g \left( x \right) \f$.
See the scaling keyword in the \ref method section for details.
