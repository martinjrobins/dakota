Blurb::
A conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
We here provide a caution regarding \c dot_frcg.  In DOT
Version 4.20, we have noticed inconsistent behavior of this algorithm
across different versions of Linux.  Our best assessment is that it is
due to different treatments of uninitialized variables.  As we do not
know the intention of the code authors and maintaining DOT source code
is outside of the %Dakota project scope, we have not made nor are we
recommending any code changes to address this.  However, all users who
use \c dot_frcg in DOT Version 4.20 should be aware that
results may not be reliable.

See \ref topic-package_dot for information related to all \c DOT methods.
