Blurb::
Group to specify nonlinear inequality constraints
Description::
The \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds specifications provide the
lower and upper bounds for 2-sided nonlinear inequalities of the form
\f[g_l \leq g(x) \leq g_u\f]
The defaults for the inequality constraint bounds are selected so that
one-sided inequalities of the form
\f[g(x) \leq 0.0\f]
result when there are no user constraint bounds specifications (this
provides backwards compatibility with previous %Dakota versions).

In a
user bounds specification, any upper bound values greater than \c
+bigRealBoundSize (1.e+30, as defined in Minimizer) are treated as
+infinity and any lower bound values less than \c -bigRealBoundSize
are treated as -infinity. This feature is commonly used to drop one of
the bounds in order to specify a 1-sided constraint (just as the
default lower bounds drop out since \c -DBL_MAX < \c
-bigRealBoundSize). The same approach is used for nonexistent linear
inequality bounds and for nonexistent design variable bounds.

The \c scale_types and \c scales keywords are related to scaling
of \f$ g \left( x \right) \f$.
See the scaling keyword in the \ref method section for details.
