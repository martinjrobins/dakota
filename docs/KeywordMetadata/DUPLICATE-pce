Description:: 
Selects a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) surrogate model to use in
the Bayesian likelihood calculations. When using PCE as a surrogate
within the Bayesian framework, the PCE coefficients can be computed
either from integration using a sparse grid or from regression using a
random/unstructured data set.
