Blurb::
Number of samples from an already-completed sampling study

Description::
The \c previous_samples keyword allows the user to specify the number
of samples in an existing sample set that is to be augmented using the
\c incremental_lhs or \c incremental_random approach.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

If not specified, Dakota will assume that there are no existing
samples.  If specified, there must be a Dakota restart file available
that contains the samples.
