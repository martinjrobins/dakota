Use AMPL to define algebraic input-output mappings 
Description::
If desired, one can define algebraic input-output mappings using the
AMPL code \cite Fou03 and save these
mappings in 3 files: \c stub.nl, \c stub.col, and
\c stub.row, where \c stub is a particular root name
describing a particular problem. These files names can be
communicated to %Dakota using the \c algebraic_mappings input. This
string may either specify the \c stub.nl filename, or
alternatively, just the \c stub itself.

%Dakota then uses \c stub.col and \c stub.row to extract
the input and output identifier strings and employs the AMPL solver
library \cite Gay97 to process the DAG specification in
\c stub.nl. The variable and objective function names declared
within AMPL should be a subset of the variable descriptors and
response descriptors used by %Dakota (see \ref variables and \ref
responses-descriptors). Ordering is not important, as %Dakota will reorder data
as needed.
