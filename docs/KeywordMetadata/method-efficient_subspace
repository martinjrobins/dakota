(Experimental) efficient subspace method (ESM)

Description:: 

ESM is experimental and its implementation is incomplete.  It is an
active subspace method, intended for use with models with high
dimensional input parameter spaces and analytic gradients.  The method
works by evaluating the response gradient at a number of points in the
input parameter space and using a singular value decomposition to
identify key linear combinations of input directions along which the
response varies.  Then UQ is performed in the reduced input parameter
space.
