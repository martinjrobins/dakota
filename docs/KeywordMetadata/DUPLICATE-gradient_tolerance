Stopping critiera based on L2 norm of gradient
Description::
The \c gradient_tolerance control defines the                                             
threshold value on the L2 norm of the objective function gradient that
indicates convergence to an unconstrained minimum (no active
constraints). The \c gradient_tolerance control is defined for all
gradient-based optimizers.
