Labels for the responses
Description::
The optional response labels specification \c descriptors is a list
of strings which will be printed in %Dakota output to identify the values
for particular response functions.

Note that the ordering of responses and descriptors in the input \b
currently must match the order of the values returned to Dakota in a
\ref interface-analysis_drivers-fork-results_file. See the example
below.

The default descriptor strings use a root string plus a numeric identifier. 
This root string is
\li \c "obj_fn" for objective functions
\li \c "least_sq_term" for least squares terms
\li \c "response_fn" for generic response functions
\li \c "nln_ineq_con" for nonlinear inequality constraints
\li \c "nln_eq_con" for nonlinear equality constraints

Examples::

Note that the descriptors \b currently must match the order of the
values in the results file; they are not used to validate the returned
data.  For example, if the \c responses block contains:
\verbatim
  \c descriptors 'x1' 'x2' 'x3'
\endverbatim

and the results file contains
\verbatim
  4 x1
  5 x3
  6 x2
\endverbatim

Then Dakota will understand the returned data to be:
\verbatim
  x1 = 4
  x2 = 5
  x3 = 6
\endverbatim
