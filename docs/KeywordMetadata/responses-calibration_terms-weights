Apply different weights to each response
Description::
The \c
weights specification provides a means to specify a
relative emphasis among the vector of squared residuals through
multiplication of these squared residuals by a vector of weights: \f[f
= \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i R_i^2 = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i (y^M_i - y^O_i)^2\f]
