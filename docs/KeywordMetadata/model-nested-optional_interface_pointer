Pointer to interface that provides non-nested responses
Description::
\c optional_interface_pointer is used to specify an optional inferface (using 
that interface block's \ref interface-id_interface label) to provide non-nested 
responses, which will be combined with respones from the nested sub-iterator. The
\c primary_response_mapping and \c secondary_response_mapping keywords control 
how responses are combined.
