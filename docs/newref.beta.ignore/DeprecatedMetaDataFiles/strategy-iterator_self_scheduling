Change how Dakota schedules concurrent interators
Description::
The \c iterator_servers, \c iterator_self_scheduling,
and \c iterator_static_scheduling specifications provide manual
overrides for the number of concurrent iterator partitions and the
scheduling policy for concurrent iterator jobs. These settings are
normally determined automatically in the parallel configuration
routines (see ParallelLibrary) but can be overridden with user inputs
if desired. 
The \c iterator_servers, \c iterator_self_scheduling, and \c
iterator_static_scheduling overrides are only useful inputs for those
strategies supporting concurrency in iterators, i.e., \c multi_start
and \c pareto_set.
