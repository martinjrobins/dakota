Specifies the top level technique which will govern the management of iterators and models
Description::
The strategy section in a %Dakota input file specifies the top level
technique which will govern the management of iterators and models in
the solution of the problem of interest. 

<b> Strategy Group 1 </b>

Four strategies currently exist: 
-# \c hybrid
-# \c multi_start
-# \c pareto_set
-# \c single_method
.
\li Additional information on the algorithm logic is
available in the Users Manual [\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"].
\li One of these must be selected, however, if it not specified Dakota
will default to the \c single_method strategy.
\li More detail about these strategies and associated keywords are given
on their individual pages.

<b> Optional Keywords </b>
In addition to the strategy, additional keywords are used to modify
the Dakota outputs - graphics and data, as well as how Dakota
will handle methods that run concurrently.

Theory::
Specification of a strategy block in an input file is optional, with
\c single_method being the default strategy. If no strategy is
specified or if \c single_method is specified without its optional \c
method_pointer specification, then the default behavior is to employ
the last method, variables, interface, and responses specifications
parsed. This default behavior is most appropriate if only one
specification is present for method, variables, interface, and
responses, since there is no ambiguity in this case.
