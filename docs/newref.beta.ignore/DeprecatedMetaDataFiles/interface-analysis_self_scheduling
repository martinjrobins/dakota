Description::
The optional \c evaluation_servers and \c analysis_servers
specifications support user overrides of the automatic parallel
configuration for the number of evaluation servers and the number of
analysis servers. Similarly, the optional \c
evaluation_self_scheduling, \c evaluation_static_scheduling, \c
analysis_self_scheduling, and \c analysis_static_scheduling
specifications can be used to override the automatic parallel
configuration of scheduling approach at the evaluation and analysis
parallelism levels. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions and a desired scheduling policy at these parallelism
levels. Refer to ParallelLibrary and the Parallel Computing chapter of
the Users Manual [\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"] for additional 
information.
