Blurb::
Write a tabular results file with both variables and responses
Description::
The \c tabular_graphics_data flag activates
file tabulation of the same variables and response function history
data that gets passed to graphics windows with use of the \c graphics
flag. 
Within the file, the variables and response functions appear as
columns and each function evaluation provides a new table row. This
capability is most useful for post-processing of %Dakota results with
third-party graphics tools such as MATLAB, Tecplot, etc. 
There is no
dependence between the \c graphics flag and the \c
tabular_graphics_data flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.
