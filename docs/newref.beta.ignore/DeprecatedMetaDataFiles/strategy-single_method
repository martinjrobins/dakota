Blurb::
(Default) Run only a single iterator and a single model
Description::
The single method strategy is the default if no strategy
specification is included in a user input file.

It provides the means for simple execution of a
single iterator on a single model. 

An optional \c method_pointer specification may be
used to point to a particular method specification. If \c
method_pointer is not used, then the last method specification parsed
will be used as the iterator.
