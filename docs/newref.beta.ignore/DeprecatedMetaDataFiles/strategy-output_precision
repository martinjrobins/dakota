Control the output precision
Description::
Numeric output precision 
can be controlled with \c output_precision with an
upper limit of 16 enforced at run-time. When this control is not
specified, most %Dakota output will default to a precision of 10,
though filesystem interfaces and pre-run output use higher precision
for accuracy and better results reproducibility.
