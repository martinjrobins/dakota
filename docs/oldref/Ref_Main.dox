\section RefOverview Overview


The %Dakota (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale
Applications) toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface
between analysis codes and iteration methods.  %Dakota contains
algorithms for optimization with gradient and nongradient-based
methods, uncertainty quantification with sampling, reliability,
stochastic expansion, and interval estimation methods, parameter
estimation with nonlinear least squares methods, and
sensitivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter
study capabilities.  (Solution verification and Bayesian approaches
are also in development.)  These capabilities may be used on their own
or as components within advanced algorithms such as surrogate-based
optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, mixed
aleatory-epistemic uncertainty quantification, or optimization under
uncertainty. By employing object-oriented design to implement
abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems
analyses, the %Dakota toolkit provides a flexible problem-solving
environment for design and performance analysis of computational
models on high performance computers.

The Reference Manual focuses on documentation of the various input
commands for %Dakota.  It follows closely the structure of
dakota.input.summary, the master input specification summary.  For
information on software structure, refer to the <a
href="../html-dev/index.html">Developers Manual</a>, and for a tour of
%Dakota features and capabilities, refer to the Users Manual [\ref
UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"].


\section RefSpec Input Specification Reference


In %Dakota, the \e environment creates the top level \e iterator and
manages output mechanisms.  A \c model contains a set of \e variables,
an \e interface, and a set of \e responses, and the iterator operates
on the model to map the variables into responses using the interface.
In a %Dakota input file, the user specifies these components through
environment, method, model, variables, interface, and responses
keyword specifications.  The Reference Manual closely follows this
structure, with introductory material followed by detailed
documentation of the environment, method, model, variables, interface,
and responses keyword specifications:
