State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
tolerances, and time step controls. 

Only parameter studies and design of experiments 
methods will iterate on state variables.

The \c initial_state is used as the only value
for the state variable for all other methods, unless \c active
\c state is invoked.

If a method iterates on a state variable, the variable is treated
as a design variable with the given bounds, or as a uniform uncertain 
variable with the given bounds.

If the state variable is defined only by its bounds, and the
method does NOT iterate on state variables, then the \c initial_state
must be inferred.
