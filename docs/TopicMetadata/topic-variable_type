Dakota variables can be grouped by their type, including \c all, \c
design, \c uncertain, \c aleatory, \c epistemic, or \c state.
There are certain situations where the user may want to explicitly
control the subset of variables that is considered active for a
certain %Dakota method, and override the default alignments between
methods and variable types.  Refer to \ref variables-active for
additional information.
