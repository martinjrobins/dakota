Epistemic uncertainty is uncertainty due to lack of knowledge.

In %Dakota, epistemic uncertainty is characterized by 
interval analysis or the Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence.

Note that epistemic uncertainty can also be modeled
with probability density functions - similarly to aleatory uncertainty
Dakota does not support this capability.
