Design variables are those variables which are modified for the
purposes of computing an optimal design.

The most common type of design variables encountered in engineering
applications are of the continuous type. These variables may assume
any real value within
their bounds. All but a handful of the optimization algorithms in
Dakota support continuous design variables exclusively.
